# User Stories Generation - Clarification Questions

I've analyzed your answers to the story generation plan questions and found 2 areas that need clarification before I can proceed with story generation.

## Ambiguity 1: Cross-Feature User Journeys (Question 7)

**Your Answer**: E) Other - "Link stories"

**Issue**: The response "Link stories" is ambiguous. I need clarification on what this means in the context of cross-feature user journeys.

### Clarification Question 1
What does "Link stories" mean for handling cross-feature user journeys?

A) Create separate journey stories (e.g., "Login → View Home → Access Profile") and link them to individual feature stories
B) Keep feature stories separate but add references/links between related stories in different features
C) Create journey stories as a separate section/epic that references the feature stories
D) Include journey information as metadata in feature stories without separate journey stories
E) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: B

## Ambiguity 2: Story Granularity Mix (Question 2)

**Your Answer**: D) Mix of levels based on feature complexity

**Issue**: While this answer indicates adaptive granularity, I need clarification on how to determine complexity levels and which granularity level to use for each type of feature.

### Clarification Question 2
How should I determine feature complexity and assign granularity levels?

A) Simple features (e.g., View Profile) = High-level stories, Complex features (e.g., Eclaims with multiple sub-actions) = Detailed stories
B) Use a complexity threshold: Features with 1-2 actions = High-level, 3-5 actions = Medium-level, 6+ actions = Detailed
C) Base on user interaction complexity: Simple viewing = High-level, Forms with validation = Medium-level, Multi-step workflows = Detailed
D) Let you specify complexity for each feature during story generation
E) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: A

Please answer both clarification questions so I can proceed with generating the user stories according to your preferences.
